				<strong>Max Rojas Vargas</strong> was born and raised in a rural farming village in the province of Cartago,
				Costa Rica.
			</p>
			<p>
				His formal studies Max received at the University of Costa Rica, thus beginning his immersion into the world of
				art. Rojas, one of Costa Ric's established watercolorists, immerses himself in his environment and transposes
				this experience to paper or canvas. The viewer is able to feel the humidity of the swollen clouds, the crispness
				of the first steam of light after the storm breaks, swirling hues caught in nature's phenomena.
			</p>
			<p>
				Max's acrylics are vigorous, energy-charged renditions conscious of space, surface and color of Costa Rica.
				Rojas also forges metal, carves in wood and weaves on looms he builds himself; total corporal involvement that
				creates art full of activity, be it conceptual or physical.
